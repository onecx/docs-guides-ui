== Code quality
Committed code must have a certain quality. The following guidelines must be considered:

*	Do not commit commented out code.
**	Comments should only be used to:
***	Document the *Why of the code* and *not* the *What*.
***	Create documentation for the autocompletion mechanism.
*	Do not commit debug outputs.
**	`console.log()` message should be used to inform about error or problem and to give some information of the application state e.g., "Configuration loaded with values xyz"
*	Remove unused imports
*	Format the code
**	Run `npm run format`
**	If you need to format a specific file, you can use:
***	`nx format:write â€“files  *_filepath_*`
