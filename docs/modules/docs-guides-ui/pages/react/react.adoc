= React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently.

== Guidelines
When developing React applications within the OneCX platform, it's essential to follow specific guidelines to ensure consistency, maintainability, and compatibility with the overall architecture. Here are some key guidelines to consider:

* **Component Structure**: Organize your components in a modular fashion, separating presentational and container components. Use functional components with hooks for state management and side effects.

* **State Management**: Utilize state management libraries like Redux or Context API to manage global state. Ensure that state changes are predictable and traceable.

* **Styling**: Follow the OneCX theming guidelines to maintain a consistent look and feel across applications. Use CSS-in-JS libraries or CSS modules for component-specific styles.

* **Routing**: Implement routing using libraries like React Router. Ensure that routes are defined clearly and support lazy loading for performance optimization.

* **Testing**: Write unit tests for components and integration tests for application flows using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

* **Performance Optimization**: Use techniques like code splitting, memoization, and lazy loading to enhance application performance.

* **Accessibility**: Ensure that your application adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG) to provide an inclusive experience for all users.

* **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for your components and application architecture to facilitate collaboration and future maintenance.


== OneCX Libraries
The OneCX platform provides several libraries to assist in React application development:

* **react-integration-interface**: A library that provides interfaces and utilities for integrating React applications with the OneCX platform.

* **react-auth**: A library that handles authentication and authorization within  React applications.

* **react-remote-components**: A library that enables the use of remote components in React applications, facilitating microfrontend architectures.

* **react-webcomponents**: A library that allows the creation and use of web components within React applications.
