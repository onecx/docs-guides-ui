[#guards-synchronization]
=== Guards synchronization
The navigation guards are now synchronized between all microfrontends. This means that during navigation, all microfrontends will have their guards executed in a coordinated manner, ensuring consistent behavior across the entire application. Navigation will only proceed if all microfrontends approve the transition. In case of a rejection by any microfrontend, the navigation will be aborted, maintaining the integrity of the application's state.

[#initial-microfrontend-load]
==== Initial microfrontend load
During the initial load of the application, it is likely that there are existing microfrontends that already approved the navigation that led to the current route. There is a scenario where the microfrontend that is being loaded initially has a guard that rejects the current navigation. In this case, the navigation will be aborted, and the application will revert to the previous state before the initial load.
