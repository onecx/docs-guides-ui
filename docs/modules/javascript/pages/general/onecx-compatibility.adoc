= Minimal Requirements for OneCX UI App Compatibility

This guide lists the minimal requirements for an UI App to be fully compatible with OneCX. Each requirement is classified as "must-have" or "should-have" and the impact of missing each requirement is described.

[#must-have-requirements]
== Must-have Requirements

[#lower-angular-version]
=== Have lower Angular package version than the Shell or respective preloader
Impact: Broken environment

* Check the Shell version and ensure your App uses an equal or lower Angular version.
* Please refer to this {troubleshooting_shared_packages}[Troubleshooting Guide shell related section] on how to use DevTools to inspect shared packages.

[#onecx-compatible-migration]
=== Constructed using @onecx/angular-webcomponents
Impact: Router out of sync, many potential issues

* For step-by-step instructions on migrating a vanilla Angular App to a OneCX-compatible microfrontend using @onecx/angular-webcomponents among other packages, refer to the xref:angular:cookbook/migrations/vanilla-to-onecx/index.adoc#migration-steps[Migration Steps in Vanilla to OneCX Migration Guide].

[#module-federation-any-technology]
=== Module-federation with remoteEntry.js (any technology)
Impact: Applications exposed with different technologies might not be compatible with the Shell

* Ensure your App exposes remoteEntry.js and is configured for module federation.

[#expose-library-assets]
=== Expose assets of used libraries
Impact: Translations missing

* Confirm assets (e.g., i18n) from libraries are exposed and available in your build output.
* Include the assets of the libraries they use in the angular.json or project.json file.

.Example assets configuration
----
...
  "build": {
    ...
    "assets": [
      ...
      // @onecx/portal-integration-angular
      {
        "glob": "**/*",
        "input": "node_modules/@onecx/portal-integration-angular/assets/",
        "output": "/onecx-portal-lib/assets/"
      }
      // @onecx/angular-accelerator
      {
        "glob": "**/*",
        "input": "./node_modules/@onecx/angular-accelerator/assets/",
        "output": "/onecx-angular-accelerator/assets/"
      }
      // @onecx/angular-utils
      {
        "glob": "**/*",
        "input": "./node_modules/@onecx/angular-utils/assets/",
        "output": "/onecx-angular-utils/assets/"
      }
      ...
    ],
    ...
  }
...
----

[#expose-library-styles]
=== Expose styles.css of used libraries
Impact: Styles of components from libraries might be incorrect

* Expose library styles in project.json or angular.json.

.Example styles configuration
----
...
  "build": {
    ...
    "styles": [
      ...
      // @onecx/portal-integration-angular
      "node_modules/@onecx/portal-integration-angular/assets/styles.scss",
      
      // @onecx/angular-accelerator
      "node_modules/@onecx/angular-accelerator/assets/styles.scss",
      ...
    ],
    ...
  }
...
----

[#sharing-range]
=== Sharing is done with '^'
Impact: We should share as much as possible

* Use caret '^' for all shared package versions in package.json (except rxjs, which should use '~').
* Refer to the {troubleshooting_installed_packages}[Troubleshooting Guide installed packages section] for correct range and examples.

[#shared-packages]
=== Angular, PrimeNG and OneCX packages are shared
Impact: Broken application

* In webpack.config.js, share all required packages
* Refer to the {troubleshooting_webpack_config}[Troubleshooting Guide webpack config section] for correct sharing syntax and examples.

[#share-angular-utils]
=== Share @onecx/angular-utils library
Impact: Might lead to unwanted side effects for your App and also other Apps in the Shell.

* Especially if @onecx/angular-accelerator or @onecx/portal-integration-interface is used and shared.
* Please check your webpack configuration and make sure to include the @onecx/angular-utils in the shared modules.

[#routing-relative-paths]
=== Routing is done with relative paths
Impact: Incorrect routing results

* Use relative paths in Angular router configuration to avoid navigation issues.
* Please refer to the xref:angular:cookbook/routing/index.adoc#general-routing-guidelines[OneCX General Routing Guide] for using relative paths and other information on routing in OneCX.

[#webpack-importmeta]
=== Webpack configuration for importMeta
Impact: Translation issues

* Ensure your webpack configuration includes the correct importMeta configuration.
* For the correct configuration, please refer to the xref:angular:cookbook/multi-language/multi-language-setup.adoc#provide-translation-path[OneCX Multi-language Translations Guide] and other information on multi-language in OneCX.

[#should-have-requirements]
== Should-have Requirements

[#module-federation-webpack]
=== Module-federation via webpack for exposing remoteEntry.js
Impact: We don't know if other technologies are working

* Prefer webpack for module federation setup.
* Verify your webpack configuration:

.Example webpack.config.js
----
...
const config = withModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'YOUR_MFE_NAME',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './RemoteModule': 'src/main.ts',
  },
  shared: share({...})
});
...
----

[#expose-app-styles]
=== Expose App styles.css
Impact: No styles for the application are loaded

* Ensure your App exposes its styles.css.
* How the styles.css is exposed depends on the package used for building the App (NX or Angular CLI).
* NX:

.project.json
----
{
    ...
    "styles": [
        {
            "input": "./src/styles.scss",
            "bundleName": "styles",
            "inject": true
        }
    ],
    ...
}
----

* Angular CLI:

.package.json
----
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "postbuild": "mv \"$(find dist/my-project-name -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'styles.*.css' | head -n 1)\" dist/my-project-name/styles.css",
    }
    ...
}
----

* Adjust the build command in package.json to rename the generated styles file to styles.css because of the hash in the filename by adding
`cp dist/replace_path_to/styles.*.css dist/replace_path_to/styles.css"`
* Ensure the styles.css including all your styles is present in the build output.

.Example package.json
----
...
"scripts": {
  ...
    "build": "nx build && cp dist/my-project-name/styles.*.css dist/my-project-name/styles.css",
  ...
}
...
----
